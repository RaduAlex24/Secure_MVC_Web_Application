# Secure MVC Web Application
This repository hosts an MVC (Model-View-Controller) web application, thoughtfully crafted with a significant focus on security. The Model-View-Controller architecture is a design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components. It enables cleaner and more manageable code, enhancing scalability and maintainability. Our application leverages this design pattern to offer CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, but what distinguishes it is its dedication to robust security measures. It boasts role-based authentication, which is pivotal in user management and access controls. In addition, it has been developed to withstand common security threats such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). This project illuminates the critical role of security in web development, serving as a model for developing secure web applications.
